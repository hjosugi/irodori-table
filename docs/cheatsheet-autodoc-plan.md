# Cheatsheet & Auto-Doc Plan

How the per-engine cheatsheets (`docs/cheatsheets/`) and the support inventory
(`docs/data-source-support-status.md`) get **collected automatically** and
**regenerated when the product changes**, instead of being hand-maintained.

This reuses what already exists rather than inventing a parallel system:

- Knowledge store: `knowledge/schema.sql` (`sources`, `source_snapshots`, `facts`,
  `implementation_notes` + FTS5), Rust `irodori-knowledge` crate, and the Node
  tools `tools/knowledge/{refresh,analyze,query}.mjs`.
- Engine registry: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/db/engine.rs` (`DbEngine`, `Wire`,
  ports) — derives `ts-rs::TS`, so it can already emit machine-readable metadata.
- Source registry: `knowledge/sources.json` already tracks the official docs for
  PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, DuckDB, MongoDB, **Neo4j** (Cypher manual
  + Browser), InfluxDB, Oracle, and more.

## Two pipelines, one store

```

- **COLLECT** keeps upstream DB knowledge fresh (cheatsheet *content*).
- **ACCUMULATE** records Irodori's own feature changes (cheatsheet *status* and the
  support inventory).
- The **doc generator** is the single writer of the generated docs; humans edit
  seeds and the template, not generated pages.

## Ask #1 — support inventory (mostly buildable now)

`docs/data-source-support-status.md` sections 1–3 are a pure function of the engine
registry. Make it generated:

1. Seed `knowledge/engines.json` as the machine-readable mirror of the registry:
   per `DbEngine`: id, wire, default port, adapter/routing, maturity, and the
   curated not-registered roadmap list.
2. `tools/docs/support-status.mjs --check` parses `DbEngine` and
   `is_unimplemented_wire()` and fails if `knowledge/engines.json` or
   `docs/data-source-support-status.md` drifts from the registry.
3. Next: add a renderer/emitter so sections 1–3 are generated instead of
   hand-curated, while section 4 ("Not registered") stays curated.

This makes "what's not supported" self-truing — adding a `DbEngine` variant or
flipping `is_unimplemented_wire` updates the doc.

## Ask #4 — auto-collected, ML-assisted cheatsheet data

The fetch half already works (`refresh.mjs`). Two upgrades:

1. **Scheduling.** Add a weekly job (GitHub Actions or local cron) that runs
   `refresh.mjs` for `enabled` sources, then `analyze.mjs --changed-only`, then the
   cheatsheet generator, and opens a PR with the regenerated pages. Per ROADMAP,
   large refreshes run through the shared job runtime (progress, cancel,
   checkpoint, bounded memory).
2. **ML extraction.** `analyze.mjs` is deterministic rule-based today. Add an
   optional model-backed extractor that reads a snapshot and emits the structured
   cheatsheet sections (connect / query model / essential statements /
   introspection / gotchas) as `facts` rows with `area = 'cheatsheet'`. Guardrails
   from `docs/knowledge-base.md` apply: every generated fact records `source_id`,
   `snapshot_id`, snapshot hash, model/prompt id, and confidence so runs are
   reproducible and auditable. ML stays **optional infrastructure** — the rule-based
   path remains the offline default, matching the "AI optional, never required"
   non-negotiable.

New cheatsheet fact shape (reuses the `facts` table; no schema change required):

| column | use |
|---|---|
| `product` | engine product, e.g. `Neo4j` |
| `area` | `cheatsheet` |
| `title` | section key: `connect`, `query-model`, `statements`, `introspection`, `gotchas` |
| `summary` | rendered markdown body for that section |
| `confidence` | `high` for rule-based/curated, model score otherwise |
| `source_id` / `metadata_json` | provenance (snapshot hash, model id) |

A new `tools/knowledge/cheatsheet.mjs` then:
- maps each cheatsheet-enabled engine → its `sources.json` ids (by `product`),
- pulls the latest `area='cheatsheet'` facts per section,
- renders `docs/cheatsheets/<engine>.md` in the template order from
  `docs/cheatsheets/README.md`, preserving hand-seeded `<!-- seed -->` sections
  until a higher-confidence fact replaces them,
- writes the **Sources** footer from the contributing `source_id`s.

`docs/cheatsheets/neo4j.md` is the **target output shape** for this generator.

## Ask #5 — feature-add → accumulate → auto-doc

Goal: when an Irodori feature lands, the information accumulates and the docs update
themselves.

1. **Feature event.** On merge, record a feature event (component, engine(s)
   touched, summary, ticket, status) into `implementation_notes` — the table
   already exists. Source can be a PR template field, a commit trailer
   (`Doc-Update: neo4j graph-view`), or an explicit `tools/knowledge/record-feature.mjs`.
2. **Accumulate.** `implementation_notes` becomes the running ledger that already
   backs `docs/implementation-progress.md`.
3. **Regenerate.** The doc generator folds notes into the generated docs:
   - `docs/data-source-support-status.md` maturity column,
   - `docs/feature-matrix.md` backlog-status cells,
   - the **Irodori-specific behavior** and **status** sections of the relevant
     cheatsheet (e.g. promoting Neo4j's "graph visualization is planned" line once
     the graph view ships).
4. **Trigger.** Run the generator in CI on merge to `main`; commit the regenerated
   docs or open a follow-up PR. Same generator, whether triggered by a knowledge
   refresh (#4) or a feature event (#5).

## Build order (smallest valuable step first)

1. **Land the docs spine** (done): support-status inventory, cheatsheet
   README/template, flagship Neo4j cheatsheet, this plan.
2. **`engines.json` seed + `support-status.mjs --check`** (done): CI-checked
   registry drift guard. Pure-local, no network, no model.
3. **`engines.json` emitter + support-status renderer**: make ask #1 generated
   rather than hand-curated.
4. **`cheatsheet.mjs` generator** rendering from curated `area='cheatsheet'` facts,
   reproducing `neo4j.md`. Still deterministic.
5. **Scheduled `refresh.mjs` + `analyze.mjs --changed-only`** job that feeds the
   generator and opens a PR (ask #4 collection).
6. **ML extractor** behind a flag with full provenance (ask #4 quality).
7. **Feature-event recording + merge-triggered regeneration** (ask #5).

Steps 3–4 are buildable next with no new dependencies. Steps 5–7 introduce
scheduling and (optionally) a model provider; confirm scope before building those.

## Open decisions

- **Memgraph & vector DBs:** finish or defer (see support-status §5) before
  generating cheatsheets for them.
- **Model provider for #4 extraction:** which provider, and is offline rule-based
  acceptable as the default until then? (ROADMAP says AI is optional/off by
  default.)
- **Generated-doc commit policy:** commit regenerated docs directly on merge, or
  always via PR for review?
